<strong>FlexLaden E-commerce Page</strong>

This is my final project for the Front-End Engineer course, where I applied advanced web development concepts to create a modern, responsive e-commerce page. Built from scratch using semantic HTML, styled with SCSS for a sleek and consistent design, and developed with JavaScript and React to deliver a dynamic and interactive experience.
The app dynamically consumes the DUMMY JSON API to display real products, ensuring up-to-date and realistic data for users. The code is carefully modularized for easy maintenance and scalability, with performance optimized for fast loading and smooth navigation. ðŸ’»âœ¨

<strong>Key highlights:</strong>
- Responsive design that adapts to any device
- Dynamic API integration for real product data
- Clean, modular, and extensible codebase
- Use of React for advanced interactivity and efficient state management
- Performance tuning for a smooth and fast user experience
